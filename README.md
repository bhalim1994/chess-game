# Chess

A chess application created with Python and PyGame.
  - Pieces movement includes regular movement, pawn promotion, en-passant, and castling.
  - Implemented check, checkmate, and stalemate functionalities (Ex. Disables a potential move if it will put yourself in checkmate).
  - Can be played locally by 2-players, 1-player against AI, or 2 AI against each other.
  - AI is achieved through a greedy MinMax algorithm.

# Instructions
